<p>Charles was asked to play for the PS 276 Kyle Jean-Baptiste Memorial Concert by his son Graeme Sibirsky.</p>
<p>Kyle was a student of Graeme's who made history by becoming the first African American to play the lead of Les Miserables, Val-Jean, on Broadway in NYC, before he died in a tragic accident a year ago. The concert was to form a Scholarship Fund in Kyle's name at his former Elementary School.</p>
<p>Charles played his solo rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow, a blues and a classical piece with Graeme.</p>
