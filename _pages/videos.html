<p>Charles was asked to play for the PS 276 Kyle Jean-Baptiste Memorial Concert by his son Graeme Sibirsky.</p>
<p>Kyle was a student of Graeme's who made history by becoming the first African American to play the lead of Les Miserables, Val-Jean, on Broadway in NYC, before he died in a tragic accident a year ago. The concert was to form a Scholarship Fund in Kyle's name at his former Elementary School.</p>
<p>Charles played his solo rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow, a blues and a classical piece with Graeme.</p>
<p>Graeme studied with his father for many years and now teaches music as well, both privately and for the NYC Department of Education.</p>

<p>This is the first time my son & I played a classical Sonata in public. This is for the PS 276 Kyle Jean-Baptiste Memorial Concert at PS 276 on June 24th, 2016. The selection is the first movement of Sonata for 2 Flutes No. 1 (although we played it with flute & piano), by JEAN BAPTISTE LOEILLET (DE GANT). Graeme chose the piece because of the feeling of lament and the shared name of "Jean-Baptiste".</p>
