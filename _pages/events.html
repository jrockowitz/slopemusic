  <p>Planning an affair, a corporate event, a reception, or just music for a party in your home?</p>
  <p>For any type of event, Charles can provide your live music, and surprisingly, live music often costs less than a DJ. Whether you want a solo piano (acoustic or electric}, or band, Charles and his musicians are available for your event. Want jazz, American Songbook, Broadway music, dance music (a mix of swing dancing, fox trot, merengue, cha-cha, fox trot, tango, rumba, rock, etc.), a classical repertoire? â€“ Charles Sibirsky and his musicians will make the music at your event an easy pleasure.</p>
